    "## NFI Spatial Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow deals with the most valuable dataset NFI produces - an annualised report on the state of Great Britain's woodlands. It has it's limitations, such as not including TOWs (Trees Outside Woods), Hedgerows or other woody linear features, but it is the most comprehensive dataset available for GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "NFI makes available their Methodology for this dataset, including it's evolution and can be found in the [Methodology and Outputs](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/about-our-statistics/methodology-and-outputs/) section. Most recently, the Area Estimates is available in the [Area Estimates](https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2022/02/mnwoodarea.pdf). The most relevant methodology document for this dataset is the [National Forest Inventory - Description of attributes](https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2022/02/nfi-description-of-attributes.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NFI dataset is slightly inconsistent both in features available and in formatting, which warrants preprocessing and re-saving in a uniform format. Various issues identified and remedied in the NFI datasets:\n",
    "- Coppice feature is misspelled on a few records in 2012\n",
    "- `Grass` and `Grassland` evolved over the years\n",
    "- Years 2012 through 2015 lack `Area_ha` feature\n",
    "- Years 2014, 2017 and 2018 lack `OBJECTID` feature\n",
    "- In 2021 there seems to be no `Power lines` or `Powerlines` at all\n",
    "- There's no data for `Windblow` / `Windthrow` for 2012 and 2013, as well as `Failed`\n",
    "- `Failed` itself isn't described in the methodology\n",
    "- And other minor issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst it's possible to take a step further and combine the entire available dataset of 11 years into one long format dataframe, we'll avoid that due to the sheer size of the dataset which would make I/O harder. We'll rely on a dictionary of long datasets for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Range\n",
    "\n",
    "NFI makes data available starting with 2010, but data for 2010 and 2011 is not too useful for comparison due to lack or significant difference in IFT_IOA feature definition. Therefore, the data range for this dataset is 2012-2022.\n",
